# Installation

## Windows

I recommend using Strawberry Perl, with which I was able to install
SDL by simply doing `cpanm SDL` in a command prompt.

## OSX

So far, I have not been able to install SDL (the perl bindings) on
OSX.  I think this is due to the lack of 32 bit SDL libraries.

## Linux

Much like the Windows installation, just a `cpanm SDL` should do it.
